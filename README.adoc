== Installing Antora and its Prerequisites

1. **Install Node.js and npm**

Install Node.js and npm preferably using nvm as the Node Version Manager: link:https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/[https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm]

- Alternatively, download and install Node.js from the official Node.js website: link:https://nodejs.org/[https://nodejs.org]
- After installing via either way, verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

[source,bash]
----
node --version
npm --version
----

2. **Run the Makefile**

Run the following at the root of the repository:

Once the Antora site is up and running it should be available locally at link:http://127.0.0.1:8080/[http://127.0.0.1:8080].
